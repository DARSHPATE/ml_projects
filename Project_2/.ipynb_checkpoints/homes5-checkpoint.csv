As you enter the home, you'll discover the hardwood floors and trim work have all been fully restored. Rumored to have once been occupied by Frank Lloyd Wright, a wall of mirrors added by the architect in the living room have been preserved and reflect the craftsman fireplace and corner built-ins. The kitchen offers custom cabinetry, premium appliances, gorgeous exposed brick and flows perfectly into the original breakfast nook and attached salon. The main house offers 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms - Both that have been remodeled with designer fixtures and finishes. The primary suite offers a large walk-in closet and opens out to a beautiful backyard with a large swimming pool and amazing outdoor living spaces that surround the home. A large detached structure offers an oversized garage and a full casita that's complete with its own bathroom, kitchen and sleeping loft.

Truly, this one is rare..so rare that this floor plan has never been on the resale market before. Why? Because people LOVE it! Not your typical one bedroom unit, this one has a den/office/dining area PLUS a 1/2 bath that really makes this a knockout floor plan. Top that with a balcony overlooking the awesome Portland Park with green grass and mature trees with a South facing downtown views and you got a winner! The rest of the unit isnt too shabby either...it has a great island kitchen with quartz counters and a gas cooktop. The bedroom fits a king size bed too! Portland on the Park has awesome community areas, pool, BBQ, Art, rooftop and more. It is a A+ classy building, come check it out!",APARTMENT,"100 W Portland St Unit 307, Phoenix, AZ, 85003",100 W Portland St Unit 307,100 W Portland St,Unit

Plenty of parking and residents have quick access to attractions like Footprint Center, Chase Field, Roosevelt Row and all of the vibrant restaurants, bars and entertainment spaces Downtown Phoenix has to offer. This triplex presents a great opportunity for investors looking for a value add opportunity or a short erm rental.

Perched on the 11th floor, this one bedroom unit has floor to ceiling glass with dual slider doors leading out to arguably the best seat in the house from the wrap around balcony! Large Island kitchen with a big window over the sink (Realtors swooned at this!) and an eat in kitchen table make the best use of space.

Live like you're in Manhattan, just without the rain and snow. 407 at Orpheum Lofts is located in one of the few walkable parts of town, with a Valley Metro Rail station just a block away at Jefferson & 1st Ave. Roosevelt Row, Footprint Center, and more all within walking distance. Exposed brick walls, vaulted concrete ceilings, exposed pipes, and a wall of windows complete the NYC loft aesthetic. Orpheum Lofts is one of the few pre-war condominiums in AZ.

Sellers Are Motivated and Very Negotiable. This is a rare opportunity to own a beautifully renovated historic home in the heart of the Willo Historic District. My clients are open, flexible, and ready to work with serious buyers. Welcome to the J and M Tharpe House, a 1919 Craftsman Bungalow filled with historic charm and modern designer updates. Located in one of Phoenix's most iconic neighborhoods, Willo is known for its architecture and close proximity to downtown arts, dining, and entertainment. Listed $100, 000 below comparable homes, this property is already priced to sell and the sellers are open to negotiation. In the past two years, the owners, including a well known interior designer, have completed extensive and thoughtful renovations to both the main house and guest house. Updates include full electrical upgrades with exterior 50 and 30 amp power, new dimmable lighting, smooth interior walls, popcorn ceiling removal, interior painting, and restored original woodwork. Additional improvements include a new roof, custom entry gates, updated fixtures and toilets, keypad locks, custom roller shades, and newer water heater, washer, dryer, dishwasher, and refrigerator. The Kool Deck has been refinished, and new mini split systems were added to both the guest house and laundry room. The exterior trim, eaves, and ceilings have also been painted. A vaulted wraparound porch sets a warm and welcoming tone. Inside, you'll find two bedrooms, two bathrooms, original hardwood and tile flooring, and a cozy wood burning fireplace. The spacious kitchen features stone countertops, a prep sink, recessed lighting, an authentic AGA stove, and French doors that open to a lush backyard retreat. Set on more than a quarter acre, the backyard is a true oasis with a sparkling pebble tec pool, mature fruit trees, lush landscaping, and a private courtyard. The property also includes a brick carriage house used as a workshop, a gated rear two car carport, and a front driveway that fits a 32 foot recreational vehicle plus two additional vehicles. The detached guest house is approximately 500 square feet and includes hardwood floors, a full kitchen with gas hook up, a fireplace, and a poolside patio. Both homes are currently leased to medical professionals at $2, 500 and $1, 800 per month, offering built-in income potential. Sellers are open to creative terms and flexible on timeline.

Just steps from The Vig, Cibo Pizza, Lola Coffee, Proof Bread, First & Last, the Roosevelt/Central Light Rail station and the Japanese Garden, you can leave 2 cars charging in the 2-car attached garage and spend the weekends exploring, or sitting on the shady front porch watching the world go by. The first floor features the attached 2-car garage, and a roomy office space with views to the shady front porch and front yard. The second floor features the first of 2 HVAC zones (the first and second floor on zone 1), wood-look vinyl flooring, an oversized sun-filled kitchen with wrap-around bar seating, gas range with stainless hood, coffee station and quartz countertops; powder room, exposed-wood beams and a large living room leading to a spacious east-facing balcony with bar-seating and city lights views; the third floor features a second HVAC zone, stacked laundry station, plenty of storage, and 2 spacious en-suite bedrooms, the largest of which has soaring 15-foot ceilings, double-vanity, high-volume ceiling fan and 2-story corner windows with city-light views just over the tree canopy below. The attached 2-car garage features hanging storage racks and two 240V power outlets for easy EV charging (chargers not included). All windows/doors feature high-end roller sunshades, with blackout variants in each of the two bedrooms (the larger of the two bedrooms are also electric/remote-controlled). Entire community roof resealed as part of HOA-mandated maintenance in late 2023. Built in just 2018, and meticulously maintained by the original owners (and McKinley Row HOA Board member), this home offers all the peace of mind of a new build with the mature landscaping and

This corner home isn't just one of the most sought-after floorplans in the building; it's the only one of its kind. A sanctuary wrapped in light, texture, and intention, it spans the entire corner of the building, offering soul and substance you won't find anywhere else. Two expansive wraparound balconies, one overlooking the canopy of Portland Park, offering front-row views of the neighborhood's rhythm and charm. Floor-to-ceiling windows dissolve the boundary between indoors and out, inviting in sunrise light and Roosevelt Row energy. Inside, warmth and character unfold in layers, from the exposed block wall with a gas fireplace to the brick that carries through from the building's exterior, grounding the space with a sense of identity that only Portland Place offers. With just 54 residences, Portland Place is a true boutique community nestled in one of Downtown Phoenix's most vibrant, walkable, and culturally rich neighborhoods. Steps from Portland Park, the Japanese Friendship Garden, Roosevelt Row's galleries and murals, First Friday events, local coffee shops, and some of the city's most beloved restaurants- you're at the intersection of art, green space, and urban energy. Residents enjoy a rooftop pool with panoramic skyline views, secure access, and two underground garage parking spaces, offering the rare blend of privacy, convenience, and connection to the best of downtown living.

Even the laundry room is impressive! (seriously, it's a cool room! Look up when you get inside!).

The master bedroom features a walk-in closet and its own 3/4 bath with double sinks & commode with privacy.

Built in 1915 for Parker L. Woodman, mining superintendent of the Copper Queen Mine in Bisbee (one of the largest in the world at that time), this Neo-Colonial home originally stood along Central Avenue at 11 E. Ashland. After serving as an art gallery for 18 years starting in mid-80's, it became the last remaining residential building on Central between McDowell and Thomas. With development approaching, it was saved from demolition and moved (by city permit) to Lynwood Street in 2006. As a condition of the move, all major systems were brought to code - new foundation, plumbing, sewer, electrical, roof, and split HVAC. What remains original are the historic details that matter - coffered ten-foot ceilings, rich fir floors, five-panel doors, painted cast stone masonry with full slab fireplace mantel, multi-light windows, and a classic Palladian gable. Currently setup as 5-8 offices (depending on configuration), some are large enough to be a conference room. Full bathroom downstairs, and a half bath up and down. Kitchen and dining room on the first floor. Zoned DTC-EEVER (Downtown Code - East Evergreen), the property offers rare live/work flexibility. It's ideally suited for office use - law, architecture, design, wellness, or consulting - or for creative studio space, gallery, or boutique retail. The zoning also permits full residential use or a combination of both. Whether you need a client-facing space with character, a quiet retreat for focused work, or a one-of-a-kind live/work hybrid, this property can adapt to your vision while maintaining its historic charm. Eight off-street parking spaces are included, along with a recorded ingress/egress easement to the west. Opportunities like this - where character, location, and zoning align - don't come around often.",SINGLE_FAMILY,"531 E Lynwood St, Phoenix, AZ, 85004",531 E Lynwood St,531 E Lynwood
